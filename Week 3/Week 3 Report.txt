Submitted by: Kushagra Raghuvanshi

1. Dataset Overview
   - Dataset: Skin Computer Vision Model (skin-ga5ww)
   - Source: Roboflow
   - Type: Classification
   - Format: Folder Structure

2. Model Used
   - Architecture: YOLOv8-Nano Classification (yolov8n-cls)
   - Framework: Ultralytics PyTorch

3. Training Results
   - Epochs: 10
   - Final Top-1 Accuracy: 97.7% (0.977)
   - Training Time: ~1 hour
   - Results Saved to: runs/classify/train3

4. Observations
   The model achieved a very high accuracy of 97.7% in just 10 epochs. 
   The loss converged quickly, and the model effectively learned to distinguish 
   between the skin lesion classes.
